Babatunde Adedigba

HSE Specialist| AI Engineer | Multi-Agent Systems | Applied ML | Industrial & Safety AI



I design and build production-oriented AI systems that solve real-world operational problems — particularly in safety, compliance, and industrial environments.

My work focuses on multi-agent architectures, hybrid ML + LLM pipelines, and scalable AI system design for practical deployment.



🚀 Engineering Focus

I specialize in building intelligent systems that combine:

• Orchestrated multi-agent architectures (RootAgent-driven routing)  
• Hybrid ML + LLM decision pipelines  
• Session-aware memory and contextual continuity  
• Structured + unstructured data processing  
• Rule-engine validation layers  
• Explainable AI components (reflective agents)  
• Automated reporting and compliance workflows  

My systems are designed for real operational environments — not demos.

🏗️ System Architecture Orientation

Typical architecture patterns I implement:

• Central Orchestrator (RootAgent)  
• Specialized domain agents (Risk, Incident, Compliance, etc.)  
• Shared session-based memory  
• LLM integration layer  
• ML inference layer  
• Deterministic validation (rule engine)  
• Reporting/export modules  

I prioritize modularity, scalability, explainability, and production readiness.
